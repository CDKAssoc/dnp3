The C# bindings are distributed as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dnp3) and uses [P/Invoke](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke)
to call the same native library functions used by the C library. The assembly only requires is .NET standard 2.0 compatible and includes platform-specific
shared libraries for 64-bit Windows and Linux that are automatically loaded by the .NET runtime.

## Mapping

C# is an object-oriented language and has support for all of the abstract patterns modeled in the code generator. This section describes those mappings.

### Errors

C API errors are transformed into exceptions containing the error enum.

:::warning
Uncaught exceptions thrown in callbacks will cause the program to terminate. User code should always wrap callback logic with `try/catch` syntax if there
is a possibility the callback will throw.
:::

### Iterators

Iterators are transformed into `ICollection<T>` by the code generator. This means that the collections returned by callbacks may be
used outside the callback, e.g. sent to another thread for processing.

### Structs

Native structs are mapped to C# classes. They have public member visibility and the constructor ensures that all values are initialized properly.

### Classes

Abstract classes are mapped to C# classes. They have a private pointer to the underlying native resource. There are two types of generated classes in C#: ones
that only have a private finalizer and ones that also provide a public `Shutdown` method.

The types that provide a `Shutdown` method represent long-lived resources like a `Runtime`, `Master`, or `TCPServer`.  Under the hood, they map to an asynchronous
Rust task executing on the Tokio runtime. The `Shutdown` method allows the user to precisely control when the resource/task will stop.

Types that do not provide a `Shutdown` method are automatically garbage collected, and native resources are deallocated in the class's finalize method. These
types of classes are typically builder objects such as `Commands`, `Request`, and `AddressFilter`.

### Asynchronous Methods

Abstract asynchronous methods are transformed into methods that return `Task<T>`. Users may then block on the task or `await` it in an async method.
