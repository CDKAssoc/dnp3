Rust's asynchronous programming model is a form of [cooperative multitasking](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/task/index.html). Once a task reaches
a point where it would normally block (e.g. reading from a socket), execution is instead released back to an executor so that another task may run. A pool of
worker threads inside the executor can efficiently execute thousands of asynchronous tasks concurrently without the overhead of per-task call stacks or
thread context-switching.

Rust supports asynchronous programming using *async* functions and *async/await* syntax. The Rust compiler transforms synchronous-looking code into
state machines that are just as efficient as what could be written by hand. Although Rust has this capability built into
the compiler, it does not include a default runtime on which to execute the asynchronous programs. Instead, users are free to pick the runtime as an
external library.

The DNP3 library runs on top of the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime which provides a state-of-the-art scheduler and platform-agnostic
networking APIs. Under the hood, an efficient OS-specific mechanism is used, e.g. *epoll* on Linux or *IOCP* on Windows. Tokio
is a modern evolution of libraries like [libuv (C)](https://libuv.org/) and [ASIO (C++)](https://think-async.com/Asio/). It leverages Rust's thread and
memory safety to make asynchronous programs that are not only incredibly fast, but also correct.  It is particularly hard to write correct asynchronous
software in C/C++ because of the need to manually reason about object lifetimes in callbacks.

## Lifetime

A `Runtime` must be created before any communication can take place. It is a shared resource for multiple communication sessions. It is typically created just
after initializing logging and is the last component to be shut down. Runtime shutdown is covered in the last section of this page.

:::note
Rust users may even share the runtime with other libraries that also use Tokio. The bindings currently do not allow for runtime sharing, but it may be possible
in a future release.

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
When using any of the bindings, setting the number of runtime threads to `0` will default to the number of system cores. This
is a safe default that will lead to good multi-core utilization.
:::

## Callbacks

Callbacks from the library to user code are invoked from the runtime's thread pool. This means that blocking during a callback will make an entire thread
unavailable for task execution. If all of the thread-pool threads are blocked, no communication sessions will be able to execute.

Applications should try to avoid blocking whenever possible. For example, when a log message is received via a callback, a synchronous call to write the message
to a file will block a thread. If this is occurring frequently on all of the pool threads, it can cause poor throughput or even task starvation. Applications
should defer blocking calls to dedicated worker threads, e.g. a user-managed thread that writes log messages to file.

:::tip
In cases where some blocking is unavoidable, it can be useful to set the number of worker threads to a multiple of the number of system cores,
e.g. 2x or 3x the number of system cores.
:::

## Shutdown

Shutting down a `Runtime` will stop all of the master and outstation communication associated with it. This is typically the last DNP3-related
operation your program should perform before exit.

Runtime shutdown is implicit in Rust when tokio::main returns.

:::note
If you don't call `shutdown` before exiting, the JVM will shutdown the runtime in its finalize method, however, garbage collection is not deterministic
and your program may never properly exit. It is best to explicitly shut down the runtime before exiting.

:::note
If you don't call `Shutdown` before exiting, the .NET runtime will shut down the runtime in its finalizer (aka destructor), however, you shouldn't rely
on this behavior. It is best to explicitly shut down the runtime before exiting.
