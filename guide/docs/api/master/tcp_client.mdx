Once created, a `MasterChannel` presents the same interface regardless of the underlying transport. A TCP client channel is created using the runtime, some
configuration, and a callback for observering to the status of the connection.

## LinkErrorMode

The `LinkErrorMode` controls what happens if framing error is detected at the link-layer. TCP is a lossless transport so the default behavior is to
close the connection. You can, however, treat the TCP more like a serial port by changing this setting to `LinkErrorMode::Discard`.

## EndpointList

An `EndpointList` is a list of remote endpoints to which the master will try to connect. It must contain at least one entry and optionally additional backup
addresses. The channel will round-robin through this list until a connection is established. The list may contain:

Endpoints consist of a `<host>:<port>` tuple where "host" is one of the following:

* IPv4 address
* IPv6 address
* domain name

## ReconnectStrategy

The `ReconnectStrategy` controls the rate at which the master retries failed connection attempts.
