:::warning
Serial port support is currently only available on Linux. We are waiting for Windows support to stabilize in a downstream dependency.
:::

Creating a channel bound to a serial port is done using the `MasterChannel::createSerialChannel` method. It takes the same serial port configuration
parameters as the outstation serial port API.

Unlike the outstation API, the master API opens the serial port API lazily after `MasterChannel.enable()` is called and will reattempt to open the port
if the operation fails.

:::note
The `LinkErrorMode` is internally set to `Discard` for serial communication channels.
