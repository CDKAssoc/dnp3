Associations are created on a `MasterChannel` by specifying some configuration and callback interfaces.

<Tabs
groupId="language"
defaultValue="Rust"
values={[
{label: 'Rust', value: 'Rust'},
{label: 'C', value: 'C'},
{label: 'Java', value: 'Java'},
{label: 'C#', value: 'C#'},
]}>
<TabItem value="Rust">

```rust
{{#include ../dnp3/examples/master_tcp_client.rs:association_create}}
```

:::note
The Rust API and the binding APIs differ with regard to associations. In the bindings, an association token is returned which is then used on the channel. In
the Rust API, an object is returned which has its own methods for performing operations on the association.

<TabItem value="C">

```c
{{#include ../ffi/bindings/c/master_example.c:association_create}}
// check error
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java">

```java
{{#include ../ffi/bindings/java/examples/src/main/java/io/stepfunc/dnp3/examples/MasterExample.java:association_create}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C#">

```csharp

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `AssociationId` struct returned when adding an association is just a token. It is needed to perform operations on a particular outstation on the channel,
but unlike the `MasterChannel`, you don't need to worry about keeping a reference to it around if its not needed. Allowing the `AssociationId` to be garbage
collected won't cause the association to be removed from the channel.

## Removing

Associations may also be removed from a channel by calling `MasterChannel.removeAssociation` and passing in the `AssociationId`.
